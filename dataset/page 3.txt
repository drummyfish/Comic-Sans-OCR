So I'm hoping a load of people are going to come out in support
of me here but I've got that sinking feeling I may be alone in
this.
Our toilet broke so I was in shopping for new ones and the sales
person joked (no doubt for the millionth time) that I'll want one
that automatically puts the seat down after I'm finished with
it. I 'joked' back and said if I didn't have a wife I could save
money and not buy one with a seat and I'd never have to hear
women complaining about putting it down again. To which he gave
me a strange look and said "but what about when you need to
poop?". I naturally pointed out that I'm a guy and therefore
don't put the seat down, I sit on the rim of the bowl. Several
embarrassing moments later, I realize that I've misunderstood
my entire life and that guys do indeed use the toilet seat. I left
empty handed and red faced.
Thinking about it now, it makes sense. Especially how men's
restrooms have seats. But I just assumed it was a unisex/cost
saving/oversight deal.
Here are some characters for debugging:
