Optical character recognition
Again, this text is from Wikipedia, this time block-aligned.
Optical character recognition (optical character reader, OCR) is the mechanical or
electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-
encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-
photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from
subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).[1]
It is widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records,
whether passport documents, invoices, bank statements, computerised receipts,
business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation. It is a
common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited,
searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes
such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key
data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial
intelligence and computer vision.
And some center aligned poetry:
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— 
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. 
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— 
Only this and nothing more.” 
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. 
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow 
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— 
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— 
Nameless here for evermore.
